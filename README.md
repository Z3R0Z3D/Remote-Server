# Remote-Server

By running this tool, you can access your server or system (if it’s on) via Telegram bot and send commands.
To run:

    First, get your Telegram bot token from BotFather and also obtain your account’s user ID.
    Next, edit the Bot.py file in the sections I’ve marked with comments.
    Then, install the required libraries.
    Finally, run the script with the following command:
    **python Bot.py**
